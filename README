This is README for Pastry execution:
------------------------------------

1. Compilation of the code.
   - Change into 'Debug' directory, and issue 'make' command
   - This will compile all the code, and generate a exe - 'pastry'

2. Cleaning the code.
   - Change into 'Debug' directory, and issue 'make clean' command
   - This will clean all the object code, dependency files, and exe.

3. Run the program.
   - Compile the code as mentioned in (1) above.
   - Issue the command 'pastry' on command line.

   - There are 5 command options where user can chose from.
	1. Add New Node
	2. Display Nodes
	3. Dump Node data
	4. Delete Node
	5. Exit

   - Description of each option is given below. 

	1. Adds a new node to the network, and updates its Node state.
           Also prints the node state to a log file. The log file is
           node specific, and shows the history of all updates.

        2. Displays the existing nodes in the network and their index. 

	3. Prints the latest node state to the console. It does not shows 
	   any history. Please check the log file for the history of updates

	4. Deletes the node from network. There are couple of known issues
	   - Process becomes defunc, as parent process is still running. 
	   - Node states are not updated as node is getting deleted. 

	5  Shuts down all the nodes in the network, and the program.

   - There could be issues in this program, as this is not a production code.
     please do accept some surprises. In case you face problem, please 
     restart the program. 
   
   - As it involves communication over socket, please give some time to port
     become free after you terminate the program forcefully.
